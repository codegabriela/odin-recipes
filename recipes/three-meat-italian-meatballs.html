    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These three-meat meatballs with turkey, beef, and Italian sausage go perfectly with your favorite marinara sauce. Serve over pasta.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
        <li>1 pound ground turkey</li>
        <li>1 pound ground Italian sausage</li>
        <li>1 large onion, diced</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>½ cup Italian-style seasoned bread crumbs</li>
        <li>½ cup quick cooking oats</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons Italian-style seasoning</li>
        <li>1 cup vegetable oil, or as needed</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Combine ground meats, onion, eggs, bread crumbs, oats, and seasoning in a large bowl until well combined. Shape into 24 (2-inch-diameter) meatballs.</li>
        <li>Heat enough vegetable oil in a large sauté pan to be 1/2 inch deep. Cook meatballs in hot oil until browned, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a glass baking dish.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 165 degrees F (75 degrees C).</li>
    </ol>
